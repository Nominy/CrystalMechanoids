# CrystalMechanoids

CrystalMechanoids allows RimWorld players to form and operate caravans made entirely of mechanoids. The mod patches many vanilla checks so mech-only caravans work properly and remain functional even when all human colonists die.

## Building

Use the included Visual Studio solution to compile the mod:

```
dotnet build 1.5/Source/CrystalMechanoids.sln -c Release
```

The compiled assembly will be placed under `1.5/Assemblies`.

## Usage

Enable the mod in RimWorld and create or reform caravans with your mechanoids. If the last human dies, the caravan will continue to exist with the remaining mechs.
